        <h1>What is Money?</h1>
        <p>For something to be money it needs to be good at certain things.</p>
        <p>It should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tough and not easily destroyed.</li>
          <li>Be able to be divided into smaller units so you can buy cheap things easily.</li>
          <li>Easy to carry around.</li>
          <li>Scarce so it holds it's value and buys the same amount of things years later.</li>
          <li>Hard to fake, so you don't have to worry about counterfeits.</li> 
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>If something can do all of the above maybe it can be used as money.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin is so good at the above that some people call it <strong>perfect money.</strong></p>
