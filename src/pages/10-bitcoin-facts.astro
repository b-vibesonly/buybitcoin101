        <h1>10 Bitcoin Facts</h1>
        <p><strong>Bitcoin and Crypto are different things.</strong> </p>
        <p>When people learn the difference they understand why Bitcoin is so special.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.</li>
        <li>No one knows who invented Bitcoin.</li>
        <li>Bitcoin is not a company, it doesn't have a CEO or leader, and can't go bankrupt. Bitcoin has nothing to do with the NASDAQ, or any political party, or a specific country.</li>
      <li>Bitcoin was inspired by decades of research into money and cryptography.</li>
      <li>Bitcoin was designed to help everyday people by preserving their wealth and making their payments impossible to block.</li>
      <li>It's incredibly difficult to take or steal someone's bitcoin when they understand how it works.</li>
      <li>Bitcoin mining creates new bitcoin. It's not solving complex math problems. It's more like a lottery that requires electricity to play, this makes bitcoin hard to produce, or fake, and keeps it scarce. <strong>Bitcoin is backed by energy.</strong></li>
      <li>Every four years the amount of new bitcoin that can be created is halved. Most of it already exists.</li>  
      <li>Bitcoin (with big B) refers to the entire Bitcoin payments system (the protocol), while bitcoin (with small b) refers to the currency/money that you can buy, use and sell.</li>
      <li>bitcoin is a really bad money for criminals or money launderers to use. It can easily be tracked.</li>
