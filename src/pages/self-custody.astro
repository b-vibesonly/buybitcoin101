        <h1>What is Self Custody?</h1>
        <p>Self-custody means you have complete control over your Bitcoin by holding your own private keys, rather than entrusting them to a third party like an exchange. This is a fundamental principle of true Bitcoin ownership.</p>
        <p>When you use self-custody solutions like hardware wallets, paper wallets, or non-custodial software wallets, you eliminate the risk of exchange hacks, freezes, or other restrictions that can occur when leaving your funds with third parties.</p>
        <p>While self-custody comes with greater responsibility (you must securely store your private keys), it's considered the most secure way to hold Bitcoin and aligns with the cryptocurrency's ethos of financial sovereignty.</p>
